# gNet

gNet is a mini Deep Learning(DL) library. It is written to understand how DL
works. It is running on CPU. It is written on Python language and used :
    
    - Numpy for linear algebra calculations
    - Matplotlib for plottings
    - Texttable for proper printing of model summary in cmd
    - wget for download MNIST data
    - idx2numpy for load MNIST data
    
some 3rd party libraries.

During devolopment, Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch and some other libraries examined.
Keras end-user approach is used. Therefore, if you are familiar with Keras,
you can use gNet easily.

gNet has not a lot functions and methods for now, because subject is written when
they needed to learn. Also, gNet is personal project. Thus, its development process
depends on author learning process.
